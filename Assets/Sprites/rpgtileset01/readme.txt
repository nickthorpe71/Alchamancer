
Thanks for your purchase.


"Retro RPG tileset 01" is suitale for low resolution retro style RPG or action RPG.
Each sprite was drawn by only 4 colors.(like a game of old handheld machine)





In "document" folder , there are pictures for explanation of each sprite.(These pictures are not sprite sheet.)









<caution> 

1. about pixels per unit(PPU)


In this asset , default pixels per unit(PPU) of each spritesheet is 15.9 .

If you have pixel perfect script (for camera and for each object) ,you had better change PPU from 15.9 to 16 before you begin constructing map.



2.about true color

Parency bug occurs in current version of unity when you use png image in [16bit] setting,so use png image in [true color] setting. 
(default setting of this asset is "true color")
